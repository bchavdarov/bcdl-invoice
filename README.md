# bcdl-invoice
A small WordPress plugin that will create your invoices as 'pdf' files. Shortcode [bcdlinvoice].

The plugin uses the latest Bootstrap classes, so that it is compatible with [bcdlblue](https://github.com/bchavdarov/bcdlblue/)

Make a translation by running this command form the plugin's directory:

`wp i18n make-pot . languages/bcdl-invoice.pot` : It will make a .pot file in its `languages/` directory (requires [wp-cli](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/guides/installing/) installed).
